          <p>
            Hello! I‚Äôm <strong>Shifah Naana</strong>, a software developer from
            Uganda, currently working at <strong>GOMO Technologies</strong> in
            Gulu. I‚Äôm passionate about creating digital experiences that are
            clean, intuitive, and impactful. I studied
            <strong>ICT at Gulu University</strong>, where I developed my
            interest in software development and problem-solving through
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, I‚Äôve worked on several projects‚Äîfrom
            <strong>finance dashboards</strong> and
            <strong>restaurant booking apps</strong> to an
            <strong>e-commerce platform called SheTrendy</strong>. I enjoy both
            the creative and logical sides of programming: designing
            user-friendly interfaces and writing efficient backend logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            What drives me is the constant opportunity to learn, improve, and
            use my skills to build tools that make life easier for others.

            <p><strong>Dear Future Me,</strong></p>
            <p>
              Remember how far you‚Äôve come ‚Äî from learning HTML basics to
              building complete React apps. The long nights of debugging and the
              joy of solving one bug at a time all led here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep that hunger to learn. The tech world will keep evolving, but
              your curiosity and consistency are your biggest strengths.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never forget your reason for starting ‚Äî to use technology to
              empower people, especially young women in tech, and to build
              solutions that make everyday life better.
            </p>

          <h2 id="extra-heading">üí≠ Additional Thoughts</h2>
          <h3>What I'm Excited About</h3>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm particularly excited about combining AI with frontend
            development, exploring GraphQL for data-driven apps, and
            contributing more to open-source.
          </p>

          <h3>My Learning Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            I learn best by building. Each project I create teaches me more than
            tutorials ever could. I don‚Äôt shy away from mistakes ‚Äî they‚Äôre part
            of my growth process.
          </p>

          <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
          <p>
            I believe great developers are also great communicators and
            collaborators. Beyond coding, I focus on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explaining technical ideas clearly to others</li>
            <li>Designing user-centered and accessible interfaces</li>
            <li>Sharing knowledge through mentorship and documentation</li>
            <li>Maintaining work-life balance to avoid burnout</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
          <p>
            I plan to keep documenting my journey, sharing what I learn, and
            uplifting others who are starting their coding path. Community has
            shaped my growth, and I‚Äôm determined to give back.
